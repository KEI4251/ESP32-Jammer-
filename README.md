### KEI 2.4GHz Jammer Overview
the **KEI 2.4GHz Jammer** operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency range, utilizing an **ESP32** and **nRF24 PA LNA** module to interfere with signals within this band. It is capable of disrupting various wireless communications, including **Bluetooth**, **BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)**, **Wi-Fi**, and **RC (Remote Control) drones**.

The jammer works by transmitting noise signals on the 2.4 GHz frequency, overpowering or disrupting the normal communication signals of devices within range. It offers four different operational modes: Bluetooth, BLE, Wi-Fi, and RC drones, allowing you to target specific types of devices.

Keep in mind that the range of the jammer may vary depending on the environment and equipment used. By equipping the device with a high-gain antenna or an RF amplifier, the effective range of interference can be significantly extended, allowing it to disrupt signals over longer distances.

> **Warning:** Use for educational purposes only. Always ensure you're complying with local regulations when using devices that transmit RF signals.
